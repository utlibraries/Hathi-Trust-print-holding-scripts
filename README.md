# Hathi-Trust-print-holding-scripts

##Perl scripts used to:
* Conform UT Austin Libraries catalog data to [Hathi Trust print holding specifications](http://www.hathitrust.org/print_holdings)
* Sanity check documents to make sure they conform to those same specifications

##Data:
* UT System's data combined data (UT Austin and other UT System institutions)

##NOTE:
* The most important script is the sanity check script, it will spit out what lines in the files do not conform to the required format.  You do need to run this script for each of the three types of data (serial, mono, multi) and specify what folder it should be looking in.
